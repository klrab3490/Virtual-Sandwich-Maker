## Project Description

The Virtual Sandwich Maker is a whimsical web application that invites users to unleash their wildest culinary fantasies. By allowing the combination of the most absurd and unpredictable ingredients, this app transforms the mundane task of sandwich-making into a delightfully chaotic adventure where creativity knows no bounds!

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Have you ever faced the dire crisis of having too many deliciously bizarre food items lying around with no real purpose?

It humorously rates these fantastical concoctions on a "logic scale," turning the ridiculous into the sublime.
